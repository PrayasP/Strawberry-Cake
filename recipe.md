# Recipe of a Strawberry cake
## Step 1
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.

### Step 2
Mix strawberry cake mix, water, eggs, and oil together in a bowl using an electric mixer on low speed. Increase speed to medium and mix batter for 2 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.

#### Step 3
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the middle of the cake comes out clean, 24 to 27 minutes.

##### Step 4
Poke holes all over the cake using the handle of a wooden spoon. Pour sweetened condensed milk over cake, letting it seep into the holes. Cool cake to room temperature, about 30 minutes.

###### Step 5
Pour thawed strawberries over cake, letting juices seep into the holes. Cover cake with whipped topping. Refrigerate.
